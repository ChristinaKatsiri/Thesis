The research aims to
 identify the most effective technique for interpreting customer feedback across various diverse digital communication channels and provide to customers a useful tool through which they can extract important information for products or interest.

The main code is in handle_booking_reviews_up_vader_csv_git.py file and can be run via a relevant python tool like idle python. 
The data set used is booking.com reviews (Hotel_Reviews.csv) which should be localy stored and can be downloaded from internet , for example from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe

There is also another file (pexels-pixabay-87651.jpg) not important for the final results but is only for the presentation of UI , but it should also be locally downloaded. 

So there are two points in the code that should be modified in order to be prorerly run. 

When UI opens there is a free test bar , where you can write parts of the hotel name for which you need to get ifno based on sentiment analyses of reviews included in Hotel_Reviews.csv

After selecting the hotel and from the drop down menu ,you can select the info needed.
